INDEES  
Definition: The index provides a location of data so that the users can go directly to the data.  
Types of Indexes : Three categories described: heaps, clustered indexes, and nonclustered indexes. Heap and clustered indexes directly affect how data in their underlying tables are stored. Nonclustered indexes are independent of row storage.  1.Heap Tables​ : When the data is small. There is no structure maintained for them. This lack of a structured and searchable indexing scheme is referred to as a heap.In a heap, the first row added to the index is the first record in the table, the second row is the second record in the table, the third row is the third record in the table, and so on. There is nothing in the data that is used to specify the order in which the data has been added. The data and records are in the table without any particular order.When a table is first created, the initial storage structure is called a heap. This is probably the simplest storage structure. Rows are inserted into the table in the order in which they are added. A table will use a heap until a clustered index is created on the table (we’ll discuss clustered indexes in the next section). A table can either be a heap or a clustered index, but not both. Also, there is only a single heap structure allowed per table.
